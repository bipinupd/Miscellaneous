I have a problem to convert the date and time into nice readable format (May 7th, 2015 15:01). 

The controller was returning the time in the form 2015/05/07 15:01:03 +0000. Wrote this function to do the conversion but decided not to use it. As advised by one of my colleague, I changed the controller to send the specific format that can directed used in the view.

 In future if I have similar problem in UI, but this time the UI is directly geeting the date and time from somewhere else. This might be helpful. 

Tested 
  -- Chrome: 42.0 
  -- Firefox: 31.6

Anyone is welcome to use it at their own risk.
